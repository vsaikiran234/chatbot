The project folder (chatbot_project/chatbot_project/) manages overall settings and routes.
The app folder (chatbot_project/chatbot/) contains the actual features and logic.
The project’s settings.py lists your app (chatbot) in the INSTALLED_APPS section, connecting them.
Summary:

The project folder = configuration and entry point.
The app folder = your chatbot’s code and features.
Both are required for your Django project to work.
